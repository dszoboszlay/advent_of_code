# My Advent of Code Solutions

This repo contains my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
solutions.

What kind of solutions can you expect to see here? Well, I optimise
for quick development, because I also have a family that demands my
time. But there are some consequences:

* I'm an Erlang developer, so I picked this language for solving the
  puzzles.
* The code can be a mess sometimes.
* It's not even optimised for performance.
* I may give up the challenge any time.
